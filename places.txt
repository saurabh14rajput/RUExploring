Around 1933, a barge was purchased from the Central Railroad of New Jersey and used to house rowing equipment.  It too was lost after a raging torrent flooded the Raritan.  The current building near the old Delaware and Raritan Canal lock was built in 1950 and is a gift of the Class of 1914.

Foran Hall was dedicated on October 30, 1995 and is a 150,400 square foot complex.  Moose Foran was a New Jersey legislator (Republican, Hunterdon County) from 1969 to his death in office in 1989 and was an early promoter of biotechnology.  Foran was instrumental in situating the AgBiotech Center at NJAES and was considered a founding father of the vision that the Center represents.  He was considered an old school statesman: he had a congenial and persuasive manner an imposing figure and quick mind.  Foran was a champion of Cook College and the NJAES and spearheaded construction of the Agricultural Museum.        The first formal recommendation for a Plant Science and Biotechnology Complex is contained in the 1988 report of the blue-ribbon Committee on the Advancement of Agricultural Research and Technology (CAART).  Since then, the State of New Jersey, Rutgers and the federal government have invested some $47 million to transform CAART's recommendation into reality.

An attractive memorial brick patio joining the Cabin and Pavilion was added.  The Log Cabin &amp; Alumni pavilion complex, which is managed by the Rutgers University Gardens and rented as a single facility, hosts a large number of weddings, parties, and campus events each year.  It is a versatile setting that is enhanced by its architectural simplicity and proximity to the seasonal splendor provided by the Gardens' many collections, and is suited to a variety of functions.","cid":"C138527","building_id":"5020","building_number":"6104","campus_code":"60","campus_name":"Cook","location":{"name":"Hort Farm No. 1 - Log Cabin","street":"140 Log Cabin Road","additional":"","city":"New Brunswick","state":"New Jersey","state_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"08901-8511","country":"United States","country_abbr":"US","latitude":"40.473540","longitude":"-74.420325"},"id":"6104_5020Hort Farm No. 1 - Log Cabin"},"6214_5070Hort Farm No. 1 - Lath House":{"title":"Hort Farm No. 1 - Lath House","description":"HORT FARM NO. 1 - LATH HOUSE","cid":"C137574","building_id":"5070","building_number":"6214","campus_code":"60","campus_name":"Cook","location":{"name":"Hort Farm No. 1 - Lath House","street":"No Street Address","additional":"","city":"New Brunswick","state":"New Jersey","state_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"08901","country":"United States","country_abbr":"US","latitude":"40.486216","longitude":"-74.451819"},"id":"6214_5070Hort Farm No. 1 - Lath House"},"6323_5151Buell Pinelands Research Station Bunkhouse & Greenhouse":{"title":"Buell Pinelands Research Station Bunkhouse & Greenhouse","description":"","cid":"C137604","building_id":"5151","building_number":"6323","campus_code":"67","campus_name":"Off-Campus","location":{"name":"Buell Pinelands Research Station Bunkhouse & Greenhouse","street":"501 Four Mile Road","additional":"","city":"New Lisbon","state":"New Jersey","state_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"08064","country":"United States","country_abbr":"US","latitude":"39.958141","longitude":"-74.628209"},"id":"6323_5151Buell Pinelands Research Station Bunkhouse & Greenhouse"},"6399_5210Buell Pinelands Research Station Dormitory":{"title":"Buell Pinelands Research Station Dormitory","description":"","cid":"C137631","building_id":"5210","building_number":"6399","campus_code":"67","campus_name":"Off-Campus","location":{"name":"Buell Pinelands Research Station Dormitory","street":"501 Four Mile Road  ","additional":"","city":"New Lisbon","state":"New Jersey","state_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"08064","country":"United States","country_abbr":"US","latitude":"39.958141","longitude":"-74.628209"},"id":"6399_5210Buell Pinelands Research Station Dormitory"},"3117_4667Frelinghuysen Hall":{"title":"Frelinghuysen Hall","description":"Named after Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen, this building was erected in 1956.

Gibbons was born on December 15, 1757 in Savannah, Ga. Among his many occupations were lawyer, politician and steamboat operator. Gibbons purchased a summer residence in Elizabethtown, NJ in 1810. He began running steam ferries between Elizabethtown Point and New York City in 1818. He also ran the steam ferries from New Brunswick to New York City, disregarding the New York monopoly grant of such traffic held by Aaron Ogden. This led to the famous U.S. Supreme Court case, Gibbons vs. Ogden (1824), in which Chief Justice John Marshall upheld national supremacy in the regulation of interstate commerce. The land now known as Gibbons Campus, was given to the college by James Neilson, who was responsible for it being named Gibbons. The land was probably originally owned by Gibbons in connection with his ferry service between Elizabethtown Point and New Brunswick which began in 1817. Gibbons died May 16, 1826 in New York City. The Gibbons Cabin was erected in 1927.

We implement a networking app which sends request to webservices and
automatically constructs a deeplink based on the retrieved data based and then
deep links to resident apps (if installed) or preserves content after
installation of the app (if the target app is not installed).

RU-Exploring is a travel app which allows users to browse through various places of
interest across Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Users can then book an Uber
cab to the place or use Google Maps to know the exact location of these
spots. There is also an option to share specific places across other people.

There are two types of deep links being used:
1.) To external webservices ie, Google Maps and Uber
2.) To RU-Exploring via. Branch.io, which also allows for content sharing.
